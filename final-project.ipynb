    "\n",
    "> In this section, you will need to provide the following information about the selected data set:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Source with a link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows \n",
    "> - Fields: show_id\ttype, title\tdirector, cast, country, date_added, release_year, rating, duration, listed_in, description \n",
    "> - License:CC0: Public Domain \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data set selection rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why did you select this data set? I chose this dataset because I am interested in media analytics and want to explore trends in content production, genre popularity, and how Netflix’s catalog has evolved over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to be answered\n",
    "\n",
    "> Using statistical analysis and visualization, what questions would you like to be able answer about this dataset.\n",
    "> This could include questions such as:\n",
    "1. How has Netflix’s content changed over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: How many movies and TV shows were released each year, and are there trends over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it matters: This can show how Netflix’s catalog is growing and what types of content they are adding more of.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What countries produce the most Netflix content?\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Which countries appear most often in the dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it matters: This helps show how global Netflix’s library is and where most content is coming from.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What ratings are most common?\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Which maturity ratings (like TV-MA, PG-13, etc.) appear most frequently?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it matters: This shows what age groups Netflix focuses on and can help with understanding audience segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What genres are most popular?\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: What are the top genres in the “listed_in” column?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it matters: This can help identify what types of shows and movies Netflix invests in the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Are movies generally longer than TV shows?\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: What is the distribution of movie durations, and how does TV episode duration compare?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it matters: This helps understand content length, which can be useful for marketing and user experience planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. When do new titles get added to Netflix?\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Are there certain months or years where more shows are added?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it matters: This can reveal seasonal patterns in how Netflix updates its catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - What is the relationship between X and Y variables?\n",
    "> - What is the distribution of the variables?\n",
    "> - What is the relationship between the variables and the target?\n",
    ">   You will need to frame these questions in a way to show value to a stakeholder (i.e.why should we know about the relationship between X and Y variables?)\n",

    "### Visualization ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "> Provide a few examples of what you plan to visualize to answer the questions you posed in the previous section. In this project, you will be producing 6-8 visualizations. You will also be producing an interactive chart using Plotly.\n",
    "> Think about what those visualization could be: what are the variables used in the charts? what insights do you hope to gain from them?\n",
